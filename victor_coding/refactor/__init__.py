"""AST-based refactoring engine.

This module provides code refactoring capabilities using AST analysis
for safe and accurate code transformations.

Example usage:
    from victor_coding.refactor import get_refactor_manager, RefactorType
    from pathlib import Path

    # Get manager
    manager = get_refactor_manager()

    # Rename a symbol
    result = manager.rename_symbol(
        file_path=Path("main.py"),
        line=10,
        column=4,
        new_name="new_function_name",
    )

    # Extract code to function
    result = manager.extract_function(
        file_path=Path("main.py"),
        start_line=15,
        start_column=0,
        end_line=25,
        end_column=0,
        function_name="extracted_function",
    )

    # Get refactoring suggestions
    suggestions = manager.suggest_refactorings(Path("main.py"))
    for suggestion in suggestions:
        print(f"{suggestion.refactor_type.value}: {suggestion.reason}")

    # Undo if needed
    if result.success and result.can_undo():
        manager.undo(result)
