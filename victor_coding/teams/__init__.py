"""Teams integration for coding vertical.

This package provides team specifications for common software development
tasks, including pre-configured teams for feature implementation,
bug fixing, refactoring, code review, and testing.

Example:
    from victor_coding.teams import (
        get_team_for_task,
        CODING_TEAM_SPECS,
    )

    # Get team for a task type
    team_spec = get_team_for_task("feature")
    print(f"Team: {team_spec.name}")
    print(f"Formation: {team_spec.formation}")
    print(f"Members: {len(team_spec.members)}")

    # Or access directly
    feature_team = CODING_TEAM_SPECS["feature_team"]

Teams are auto-registered with the global TeamSpecRegistry on import,
enabling cross-vertical team discovery via:
    from victor.framework.team_registry import get_team_registry
    registry = get_team_registry()
    coding_teams = registry.find_by_vertical("coding")
