"""Team specifications for coding tasks.

Provides pre-defined team configurations for common software development
workflows including feature implementation, bug fixing, refactoring,
and code review.

This module uses the framework's multi-agent types (TeamTemplate, TeamSpec,
TeamMember) while providing domain-specific team configurations for coding tasks.

DEPRECATION NOTICE:
    CodingTeamSpec is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
    Use TeamSpec from victor.framework.team_schema instead:

        from victor.framework.team_schema import TeamSpec

    CodingTeamSpec is maintained for backwards compatibility.
