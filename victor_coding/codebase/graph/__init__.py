"""Graph storage module for codebase analysis.

This module re-exports from the core victor.storage.graph module for backward
compatibility. The graph storage infrastructure is now part of victor-core
and available to all verticals.

For new code, prefer importing directly from victor.storage.graph:
    from victor.storage.graph import GraphNode, GraphEdge, create_graph_store
