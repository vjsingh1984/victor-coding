"""Coding workflow provider.

Uses YAML-first architecture with Python escape hatches for complex
conditions and transforms that cannot be expressed in YAML.

All workflows are defined in YAML files (*.yaml) in this directory:
- feature.yaml: Feature implementation workflows
- bugfix.yaml: Bug fix workflows
- code_review.yaml: Code review workflows (includes pr_review)
- tdd.yaml: Test-driven development workflows
- refactor.yaml: Refactoring workflows

Escape hatches for complex conditions/transforms are in:
- victor/coding/escape_hatches.py

Example:
    provider = CodingWorkflowProvider()

    # Compile and execute (recommended - uses UnifiedWorkflowCompiler with caching)
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("code_review", {"files": ["src/"]})

    # Stream execution with real-time progress
    async for node_id, state in provider.stream_compiled_workflow("code_review", context):
        print(f"Completed: {node_id}")

Available workflows (all YAML-defined):
- feature_implementation: Full feature implementation workflow
- quick_feature: Quick feature for small changes
- bug_fix: Systematic bug investigation and fix
- quick_fix: Quick fix for simple bugs
- code_review: Comprehensive code review with parallel analysis
- quick_review: Quick code review for small changes
- pr_review: Pull request review workflow
- tdd_cycle: Test-driven development cycle
- refactor: Code refactoring workflow
