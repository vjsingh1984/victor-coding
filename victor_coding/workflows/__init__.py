"""Coding vertical workflows.

This package provides workflow definitions for common coding tasks using
YAML-first architecture with Python escape hatches for complex conditions.

Available workflows (all YAML-defined):
- feature_implementation: Full feature implementation workflow
- quick_feature: Quick feature for small changes
- bug_fix: Systematic bug investigation and fix
- quick_fix: Quick fix for simple bugs
- code_review: Comprehensive code review with parallel analysis
- quick_review: Quick code review for small changes
- pr_review: Pull request review workflow
- tdd_cycle: Test-driven development cycle
- refactor: Code refactoring workflow

Usage:
    from victor_coding.workflows import CodingWorkflowProvider

    provider = CodingWorkflowProvider()

    # List available workflows
    print(provider.get_workflow_names())

    # Execute with caching (recommended - uses UnifiedWorkflowCompiler)
    result = await provider.run_compiled_workflow("code_review", {"files": ["src/"]})

    # Stream with real-time progress
    async for node_id, state in provider.stream_compiled_workflow("code_review", {}):
        print(f"Completed: {node_id}")

This package also provides LCEL-composed tool chains for fine-grained
code operations (explore, analyze, edit, refactor, etc.).
