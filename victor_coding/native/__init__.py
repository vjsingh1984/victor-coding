"""Native performance extensions (Rust via PyO3).

This module provides optional native (Rust) implementations of performance-critical
operations. When the Rust extensions are not installed, this module provides
fallback stubs that raise ImportError with helpful messages.

NOTE: Tree-sitter extraction is NOT included in native extensions because Python's
tree-sitter bindings already provide efficient access to the C library. Adding Rust
would introduce FFI overhead (Python → Rust → C) without performance benefits.

The native extensions provide:
- Fast code chunking with zero-copy string operations
- Fast regex processing using Rust's regex crate

The native extensions can be installed via:
    pip install victor-ai[native]

Or built from source:
    maturin develop --release

Usage:
    try:
        from victor_coding.native import FastChunker, FastRegexProcessor
        # Use native implementations
    except ImportError:
        # Fall back to Python implementations
        from victor_coding.codebase.chunker import CodeChunker
